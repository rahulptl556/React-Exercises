Steps to start a project:
i) 1st thing you do is create a backend (create folder)
Initialise a node project ie; put package.json - this is important as it holds all the dependencies and scipts we will be using and helps developers to read it

-Switch to backend folder
-RUN npm init 
-Set name backend-todo
-Version - will play a imp role when we work on projects but for now select 1.0.0
-Set other few things that it asks, not imp for now
and Enter
-INSTALL EXPRESS - npm i express
-As you install any lib or dependency, node module folder appears which hold the libraries locally. 
-IMP - When you share your code with someone or on github you dont send node modules, You package.json has all the dependencies mentioned, so when you friend run npm init, it check the package.json dependencies json like what all is mentioned and downloads all the node modules locally.  (Thats why always create a package.json 1st it help developer to understand tech used)
